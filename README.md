# YYCHR-Snes5BppPlanar
Plugin for YY-CHR to handle an obscure SNES 5bpp planar format used only by the player portraits in NBA Jam and NBA Jam Tournament Edition.
This is based on the YY-CHR SNES 8bpp planar plugin by mrehkopf a.k.a. ikari_01: https://github.com/mrehkopf/YYCHR-Snes8BppPlanar

To compile, place a copy of CharactorLib.dll from YY-CHR into the same directory as Snes5BppPlanar.cs.
